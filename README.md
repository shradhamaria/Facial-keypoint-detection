# Facial Keypoint Detection

This repository is part of the Udacity Nanodegree program and focuses on facial keypoint detection. The project involves creating a complete pipeline for detecting facial keypoints in images.

## Overview
- **data_load.py**: This script contains functions for loading and preprocessing the facial keypoint data.
- **filelist.txt**: A list of files used in the project.
- **models.py**: Defines the neural network architecture for facial keypoint detection.
- **workspace_utils.py**: Utility functions for managing resources in the workspace.

## Jupyter Notebooks
1. **1. Load and Visualize Data.ipynb**: Introduction to loading and visualizing the facial keypoint data.
2. **2. Define the Network Architecture.ipynb**: Overview of the neural network architecture used for keypoint detection.
3. **3. Facial Keypoint Detection, Complete Pipeline.ipynb**: Complete pipeline for facial keypoint detection, including data loading, model training, and testing.
4. **4. Fun with Keypoints.ipynb**: Fun experiments and visualizations with facial keypoints.

## How to Use
You can run the Jupyter notebooks to interactively explore the code and visualize the facial keypoint detection process. Simply open each notebook and execute the cells sequentially to understand the steps involved.

Note: This project was last updated three years ago as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. The provided notebooks and scripts offer a comprehensive insight into the implementation of facial keypoint detection.
